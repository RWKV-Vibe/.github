Hi everyone! Welcome to the RWKV-Vibe organization — a unified entry point for community-driven RWKV projects.

RWKV-Vibe is made up of contributors from the RWKV community. Our mission is to support the growth of the RWKV ecosystem and make the RWKV project easier to use.

We aim to provide:
- Simple and intuitive tools for training and inference
- Various optimizations tailored for RWKV models
- Comprehensive guides and tutorials for using RWKV
- A curated list of awesome RWKV projects

We warmly welcome everyone to join us and contribute to the development of the RWKV community. You're also welcome to donate your RWKV-related projects to the RWKV-Vibe organization — you'll still retain full ownership and maintainership of your repositories.
